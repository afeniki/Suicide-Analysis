SUICIDE ANALYSIS:

Suicide remains a pervasive and tragic reality worldwide, claiming countless lives annually. It stands as a stark reminder of the deep-seated struggles individuals face and the urgent need for comprehensive intervention.

This analysis covers data gotten from 101 countries, with other information such as: year	sex, age,	suicides_no	population,	suicides/100k pop,	 gdp_for_year ($), 	gdp_per_capita ($), and	generation.
My dataset was gotten from kaggle.
From this dataset, I would be deriving the following insights:
1. Gender with the highest number of suicides
2. Country with the highest number of suicide rates
3. Countries with the highest GDP
4. What generation had the highest suicide rate?
5. What countries had the highest population?
6. What age-grou[p has the highest number of suicide rate?

To derive this insights from the dataset, I first of all had to;
1. Load my dataset into my Excel
2. Tranform my data into a table for easier cleaning processes.

3. Clean my data which involved removal of blank values, and duplicate data. Maintaining a consistent data format was also done.
4. Creating pivot table to summarize my data.

5.  Create my pivot charts to visualize my data from my pivot tables
6.  Create my dashboards and insert slicers to give an effective data story.
   Below is my interactive dashboard, with my major insights highlighted.
